# Application-of-Data-Structures
Lab Projects Developed in ECE250

The projects applied data structures including stacks, hash tables, trees and graphs in real-life examples. Each lab project has a design document (design.pdf) which explains the data structures and the functions used.

### Lab1 - Stacks
The real-life example in this lab is a a playlist of songs. The program allows the user to add songs to this list (at the end of the list), and select a song to be played.


### Lab2 - Hash Tables
This project implemented two methods to handle collisions in a hash table: linear probing and seperate chaining. The program allows the user to search, insert and delete item in the hash table.


### Lab3 - Trees
The real-life example in this lab is a Quadtree that stores informations related to cities based on their latitudes and longitudes. Each node of the tree holds information of its own and connects with its neighbors in different directions (NW, NE, SW, SE). 


### Lab4 - Graphs
The real-life example in this lab is similiar to Lab3, but this time the cities are the nodes of the graph. The objective of the lab is to find shortest path between two cities in the graph using Dijktsraâ€™s algorithm.
