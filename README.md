# Application-of-Data-Structures
Lab Projects Developed in ECE250

The projects applied data structures including stacks, hash tables, trees and graphs in real-life examples. Each lab project has a design document (design.pdf) which explains the data structures and the functions used.


### Lab1 - Stacks
The real-life example in this lab is a playlist, and the program can search, insert, delete and play a song according to the command line inputs.


### Lab2 - Hash Tables
This project implemented two methods to handle collisions in a hash table: linear probing and seperate chaining. 


### Lab3 - Trees
The real-life example in this lab is a city map. Every city in the tree contains information of its own and connects with its neighbors in different directions (NW, NE, SW, SE). 


### Lab4 - Graphs
The real-life example in this lab is a city map too, but this time the cities are the nodes of the graph. The distance between two cities can be set, and the main functionality achieved in this lab is finding the shortest distance between two specific cities.
